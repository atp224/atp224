Hello, I'm Aaron Pham! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ About Me:

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara University, where my passion for technology and innovation finds its home. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to explore the vast possibilities within the field of computing.

ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience:

Over the past two years, I've ventured into the dynamic world of e-commerce through the use of bot software, automating the purchase of high-demand items such as shoes, consoles, art pieces, and concert tickets. This initiative not only honed my technical skills but also equipped me with a keen sense for market demands. My journey has led to hundreds of successful sales across various online platforms, underlining my knack for blending technology with entrepreneurship.

ðŸŒ± Volunteering and Mentorship:

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am an Eagle Scout â€” a testament to my commitment to community service and personal development. With hundreds of hours dedicated to volunteering, I've had the privilege of making a tangible difference in my community. My role as a mentor for young adults in survival and life skills is particularly rewarding, allowing me to pass on knowledge and foster resilience in the next generation.
