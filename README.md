I am a passionate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara University.
I have over two years of experience using bot software to automate purchases of high demand shoes, consoles, art, concert tickets, etc. I then sell these items for profit. I have hundreds of sales over multiple online platforms.
I am an Eagle Scout with hundreds of hours in volunteering and community service. I actively mentor and teach young adults survival and life skills.
